# Procedural2DMapGenerator
A multi-engine tool to make procedural 2D maps. Made in C++, libs for Unity and Unreal



# Usage

You can try it directly on the two test projects included. ./UnityTestProject and ./UnrealTestProject. Just open the project with the engine of your choice. 

- In **Unity** you may use and test the different algorithms from Tools->ProceduralGenerator++
- In **Unreal** you can see directly a map created in runtime in the included Level. The code for generating this is in the MapGenerator Blueprint.
